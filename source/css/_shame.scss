//  "If anyone has to add a quick hack, they add it to shame.css, this means 
//  that they’re putting their hacks out there in the open; it means that they 
//  are aware that what they’re doing is hacky, it forces them to document what 
//  the problem was, how the hack fixes it, and how they might fix it for real 
//  given more time.
//
//  - If it's a hack, it goes in shame.css.
//  - Document all hacks fully:
//    - What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//    - Why was this needed?
//    - How does this fix it?
//    - How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//  - Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then 
//    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
//  - Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
//    - Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual 
//      sprint time to it.

//
//  EXAMPLE:
//
//    //
//    // Nav specificity fix.
//    //
//    // Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a{}`) which trumps the
//    // nav selectors (`.site-nav a{}`). Use !important to override it until I
//    // have time to refactor the header stuff.
//    //
//    .site-nav__link {
//        color: #BADA55 !important;
//    }
