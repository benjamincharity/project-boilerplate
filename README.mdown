# A ready to go [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) Project

### Using:

- HTML5
- HAML
- SCSS
 - Compass
 - Partials
- SASS folder also included for SASS lovers
- My custom reset (based off of the [Meyer Reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/) and the [HTML5 Boilerplate Reset](http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/The-style/), then tweaked over a few years)
- Shortened folder names (`/js/`, `/i/`, `/css/`)
